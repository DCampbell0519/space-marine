# SPACE MARINE

## Description:
Space Marine is a fun, single-player, choose your own adventure game.  You play as Marcone, AKA The Viper, in a futuristic sci-fi universe at war.  The Kinammon Empire is laying siege to the cosmos, enslaving who they can, and annihilating who they can't.  Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to destroy the Kinammon flagship, The Killmonger, by any means necessary.  With multiple decision branches to choose from and 12 distinct endings, Space Marine will be an excellent use of 15 minutes of your day!

## Background Information:
Frankly, I chose this game because the other options felt monumentally above my current skill level.  A Choose Your Own Adventure Game felt pretty straightforward, and the logic seemed to make sense.  But in very typical *Donovan-esque* fashion, I believe I chose the most complicated and verbose approach one could possibly attempt.  The ***win/loss logic*** however, was a mechanic I was particularly proud of.  Every decision you make comes with a pre-determined point value, as well as a randomized ***luck*** value, that together, add to the Player's Score.  Once you reach the end of the game, your total score determines the outcome of the story.

## Getting Started:
- Open your preferred browser (unless you prefer Internet Explorer, in which case, navigate to Google Chrome like an adult), navigate to [Space Marine](https://dcampbell0519.github.io/space-marine/) and enjoy!
- Space Marine is pretty straight forward.  You start with 3 distinct branches, each with a distinct story to follow.  As you iterate through, read the prompts and choose how you would like to proceed.  
- Will you be the hero of the story?  Or become just another cog in the war machine known as the Kinammon Empire?

## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Tears
- Obscene amounts of profanity and hair pulling

## Stretch Goals:
There were quite a few features I wanted to implement, but didn't get around to:
- An ***Easter-Egg style***, hidden, click-able box on the occasional card that would split the player off into a hidden story branch.
- Audio Track.
- A ***Go Back 1*** box to go alongside the ***Reset Mission*** box.
- Adjust the HTML and CSS to scale for smaller screens.
- A more dynamic, visually stimulating, GAME OVER screen for when the user dies or fails their mission.
- Two additional characters, each with their own stories to play through --- The Slave Knight, and the Pacifist Monk.
